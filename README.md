# GoLang Channels Practice
### Worked while taking the CIIC4030 (Programming Languages) course at UPRM, Fall 2020.

This project was a practice assignment that utilizes the channels in Go Language to concurrently run a process. The program runs a dummy task that has a certain percent to "fail" for an amount of times, which will then retry a certain amount of times if it "fails". At the end, it will return the results of the tasks.
